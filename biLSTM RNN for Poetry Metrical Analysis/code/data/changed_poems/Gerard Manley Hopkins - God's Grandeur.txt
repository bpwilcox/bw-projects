The world is charged with the grandeur of God.

It will flame out, like shining from shook foil;

It gathers to a greatness,  like the ooze of oil

Crushed.  Why do men then now not reck his rod?

Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;

And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;

And wears man's smudge and share's man's smell: the soil

Is bare now,  nor can foot feel, being shod.

And for all this, nature is never spent;

There lives the dearest freshness deep down things;

And though the last lights off the black West went

Oh, morning,  at the brown brink eastward, springs -- 

Because the Holy Ghost over the bent

World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.
