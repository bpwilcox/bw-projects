He ended: Arthur knew the voice; the face
-+-+-+-+-+
Well nigh was helmet-hidden, and the name
++-+-+---+
Went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind.
-+--+-+-+-+
And Arthur deigned not use of word or sword,
-+-+-+-+-+
But let the drunkard, as he stretched from horse
-+-+-+-+-+
To strike him, overbalancing his bulk,
-+-+-+-+-+
Down from the causeway heavily to the swamp
+--+-+--+-+
Fall, as the crest of some slow-arching wave,
+--+--++-+
Heard in dead night along that table-shore,
+-++-+-+-+
Drops flat, and after the great waters break
++-+--++-+
Whitening for half a league, and thin themselves,
+---+-+-+-+
Far over sands marbled with moon and cloud,
+--++--+-+
From less and less to nothing; thus he fell
-+-+-+-+-+
Head-heavy; then the knights, who watched him, roared
++-+-+-+-+
And shouted and leapt down upon the fallen;
-+--++-+-+-
There trampled out his face from being known,
++-+-+---+
And sank his head in mire, and slimed themselves:
-+-+-+-+-+
Nor heard the King for their own cries, but sprang
-+-+--++-+
Through open doors, and swording right and left
-+-+-+-+-+
Men, women, on their sodden faces, hurled
++---+-+-+
The tables over and the wines, and slew
-+-+-+-+-+
Till all the rafters rang with woman-yells,
-+-+-+-+-+
And all the pavement streamed with massacre.
-+-+-+-+-+
