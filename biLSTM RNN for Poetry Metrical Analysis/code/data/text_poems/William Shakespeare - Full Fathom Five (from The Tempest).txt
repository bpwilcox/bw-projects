Full fathom five thy father lies;
++-+-+-+
Of his bones are coral made;
+-+-+-+
Those are pearls that were his eyes:
+-+-+-+
Nothing of him that doth fade,
+-+-+-+
But doth suffer a sea change
+-+--++
Into something rich and strange.
+-+-+-+
Sea nymphs hourly ring his knell:
+-+--+-+
Ding-dong.
++
Hark! Now I hear them: Ding-dong, bell.
