How at once should I know
+-+--+
When stretched in the harvest blue
-+--+-+
I saw the swift's black bow,
-+-+++
That I would not have that view
--+-+-+
Another day
-+-+
Until next May
-+++
Again it is due?
-+--+
The same year after year--
-++--+
But with the swift alone.
-+-+-+
With other things I but fear
-+-+--+
That they will be over and done
-+--+--+
Suddenly
+-+
And I only see
--+-+
Them to know them gone.
--+-+
