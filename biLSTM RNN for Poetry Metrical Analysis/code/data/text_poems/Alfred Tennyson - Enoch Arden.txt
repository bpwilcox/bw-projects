Long lines of cliff breaking have left a chasm;
++-++--+-+-
And in the chasm are foam and yellow sands;
-+-+--+-+-+
Beyond red roofs about a narrow wharf
-+++-+-+-+
In cluster; then a mouldered church; and higher
-+-+-+-+-+-
A long street climbs to one tall-towered mill;
-+++-+++-+
And high in heaven behind it a gray down
-+-+--+--++
With Danish barrows;  and a hazel wood,
-+-+-+-+-+
By autumn nutters haunted, flourishes
-+-+-+-+-+
Green in a cuplike hollow of the down.
