Give me the lowest place: not that I dare
+--+-++--+
Ask for that lowest place, but Thou hast died
+--+-+-+-+
That I might live and share
-+-+-+
Thy glory by Thy side.
-+-+-+
Give me the lowest place: or if for me
+--+-+-+-+
That lowest place too high, make one more low
-+-+-++--+|-+-+-++-++
Where I may sit and see
-+-+-+
My God and love Thee so.
