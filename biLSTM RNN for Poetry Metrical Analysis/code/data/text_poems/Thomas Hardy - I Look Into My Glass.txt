I look into my glass,
-++--+|-+-+-+
And view my wasting skin,
-+-+-+
And say, "Would God it came to pass
-+++-+-+
My heart had shrunk as thin!"
-+-+-+
For then, I, undistrest
-+-+-+
By hearts grown cold to me,
-+++-+
Could lonely wait my endless rest
-+-+-+-+
With equanimity.
-+-+-+
But Time to make me grieve,
-+-+-+
Part steals, lets part abide;
++-+-+
And shakes this fragile frame at eve
-+-+-+-+
With throbbings of noontide.
